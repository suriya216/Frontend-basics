            The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. 
            Also called the domestic dog, 
            it is derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves, 
            and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. 
            Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by 
            hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the 
            development of agriculture.

        <h1>The Alternate CSS Box Model</h1>
        <div class="div1">
            In the alternative box model, any width is the width of the visible box on the page.
            The content area width is that width minus the width for the padding and border. 
            No need to add up the border and padding to get the real size of the box.
            To turn on the alternative model for an element, set box-sizing: border-box on it:
        </div>
        <div class="div2">
            The CSS box model as a whole applies to block boxes and defines how the different parts of a box — margin,
             border, padding, and content — work together to create a box that you can see on a page. 
             Inline boxes use just some of the behavior defined in the box model.
